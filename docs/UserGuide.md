`Parameter` - Field that needs to be filled up.

### Parameter Information

The parameters used in lesSON have certain specifications. Here are some information to guide you through 
how to use them. Invalid inputs are just one of many examples of invalid inputs. Cases that do not appear in the table may also be invalid if it is not of the accepted format.

# User Interface Overview

Here is a quick overview of the user interface to get you oriented with where things are.

![gui_overview](./images/UserGuide/1.3b_ui_overview.png)

* Command Line Box - lesSON is optimised for typing commands. Type your commands in the command box
to create and change flashcards!
* Result Box - after inputting a command, the result will show up here. Any errors produced will also appear here, for
instance in the event of a wrongfully formatted command.
* Deck List - shows the list of flashcards

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Tutorial

This tutorial explains how to add, edit, tag, and practise your flashcards. Feel free to follow along with lesSON open!
For advanced users, feel free to look at the [feature list](#feature-list) instead.

1. Firstly, let's add a card. type: <br>`add q/what does + mean in boolean algebra? a/it means OR.`
2. Next, let's capitalise our previous input! Assuming the card is at index `1`, input: <br>`edit 1 q/What does + mean in boolean
algebra? a/It means OR.`
3. Next, let's tag it under the module CS1231S by inputting: <br>`edit 1 t/CS1231S`
4. Feel free to add a few more cards by following steps 1 to 3!
5. Next, to practise the first card, do: <br> `practise`
6. Try to recall the answer, and when you are ready to reveal the answer, do: <br> `solve`
7. How hard was the answer to recall? set the difficulty by doing one of these: <br>
`set d/easy`
`set d/medium`
`set d/hard`
8. The card will automatically be reinserted into deck. This is based on how difficult you found the card. Due to our
spaced repetition system, as you practise, the more difficult cards will surface more at the top.
9. Note that the `practise`, `solve`, and `set` commands support indexes, but it is recommended to use them without
indexes, as in this tutorial, to always operate on the most difficult card.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### To Note:
1. Do not stack MarkDown Syntax. This may lead to unexpected behavior of text in the display view. 
2. Do ensure that the phrase intended for styling is wrapped within an open and close syntax of the same type, i.e. `**bold**` for bold `*italics*` for italics and `<u>underline</u>` for underline. 
3. In the case when unexpected MarkDown format is observed, edit the flashcard again with the without the MarkDown syntax/with appropriate syntaxes.
