# Installation

1. Make sure that you have [Java 11 or above](https://www.java.com/en/download/) installed on your computer.
2. Download the latest jar file from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W17-4/tp/releases/tag/v1.3(trial)).
3. Move the jar file installed to a working folder you would store all of your flashcards
4. Launch lesson by doing the following:
   1. In the terminal or command prompt, use the `cd` command to navigate to the working folder.
   [Not sure how to use cd?](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.2?topic=directories-changing-another-directory-cd-command)
   2. Run lesSON using `java -jar lesSON.jar`

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Quick Start

1. To understand the terms we use in this guide better, check out [our glossary](#glossary).
2. Better understand the GUI using [this guide](#user-interface-overview).
3. For new users, we recommend reading [this tutorial](#tutorial).
4. For advanced users, view all feature details in the [feature list](#feature-list).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Glossary

`Deck` - A scrollable list of flashcards on the GUI.

`Flashcard`- A card created by the user containing its index, question, answer (not shown) and due date.

`Index` - The relative position of a flashcard within the deck.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# User Interface Overview

Here is a quick overview of the user interface to get you oriented with where things are.

![gui_overview](./images/UserGuide/1.3_gui_overview.png)

* Command Line Box - lesSON is optimised for typing commands. Type your commands in the command box
to create and change flashcards!
* Result Box - after inputting a command, the result will show up here. Any errors produced will also appear here, for
instance in the event of a wrongfully formatted command.
* Deck List - shows the list of flashcards

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Tutorial

This tutorial explains how to add, edit, tag, and practise your flashcards. Feel free to follow along with lesSON open!
For advanced users, feel free to look at the [feature list](#feature-list) instead.

1. Firstly, let's add a card. type: <br>`add q/ what does + mean in boolean algebra? a/ it means OR.`
2. Next, let's capitalise our previous input! Assuming the card is at index `1`, input: <br>`edit 1 q/ What does + mean in boolean
algebra? a/ It means OR.`
3. Next, let's tag it under the module CS1231S by inputting: <br>`edit 1 t/CS1231S`
4. Feel free to add a few more cards by following steps 1 to 3!
5. Next, to practise the first card, do: <br> `practise`
6. Try to recall the answer, and when you are ready to reveal the answer, do: <br> `solve`
7. How hard was the answer to recall? set the difficulty by doing one of these: <br>
`set d/easy`
`set d/medium`
`set d/hard`
8. The card will automatically be reinserted into deck. This is based on how difficult you found the card. Due to our
spaced repetition system, as you practise, the more difficult cards will surface more at the top.
9. Note that the `practise`, `solve`, and `set` commands support indexes, but it is recommended to use them without
indexes, as in this tutorial, to always operate on the most difficult card.

Setting the difficulty of a flashcard

This difficulty refers to how difficult you found the flashcard.

### Important Note:
Do not stack MarkDown Syntax

Example:
`` edit 1 q/ *** ``

This may lead to unexpected behavior of text in the display view.

# Additional Features

## MarkDown Syntax

For user who wish to incorporate styling in lesSON, there are 3 font styles currently supported:
1. Bold
2. Italic
3. Underline

### Bold
To bold a line of text, wrap text with `**`

#### Example:
```
edit 1 q/ How many bits can a **Half Adder** add up
```
#### Expected Result:
![usage of bold syntax](./images/UserGuide/1.3_bold.png)

### Italic
To italicise a line of text, wrap text with `*`

#### Example:
```
edit 1 q/ How many bits can a *Half Adder* add up
```
#### Expected Result:
![usage of bold syntax](./images/UserGuide/1.3_italic.png)

### Underline
To underline a line of text, insert `<u>` at the beginning of the text,
and end with `</u>` at the end of the underlined text.

#### Example:
```
edit 1 q/ How many bits can a <u>Half Adder</u> add up
```
#### Expected Result:
![usage of bold syntax](./images/UserGuide/1.3_underline.png)


### Important Note:
Do not stack MarkDown Syntaxes

Example:
`` edit 1 q/ *** ``


This may lead to unexpected behavior of text in the display view. In the case when unexpected MarkDown format is observed, edit the flashcard again with the without the MarkDown syntax/ with appropriate syntaxes.
