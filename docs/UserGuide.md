## Introduction

#### ***Revolutionise your studying experience with lesSON!***

Welcome to the user guide for lesSON, your ultimate companion in mastering the Computer Science
curriculum at the National University of Singapore (NUS). This guide is designed to provide you with a
comprehensive understanding of the app and how to leverage its powerful features for your academic success.

##### What is lesSON?

lesSON is not just another study app; it's a game-changer in the world of education.
Tailored specifically for NUS Computer Science students, this application revolutionizes the
way you learn and revise. Say goodbye to time-consuming note-taking, and say hello to a more efficient,
effective, and enjoyable study experience, where flashcard creation is made incredibly easy.

To maximise your study experience, here are some features we believe you'll love:
1. **Enhanced Memory Retention:** Thanks to lesSON's inbuilt spaced repetition system, you can supercharge
your memory and recall. The app optimizes when you should review your flashcards, ensuring you remember and grasp
complex concepts with ease.
2. **Intuitive Card Categorization:** lesSON helps you categorize your flashcards based on subject. This feature
makes it a breeze to organize and access specific topics, keeping your study sessions focused and productive.

##### Prerequisites

Before you get started with lesSON, here's what we recommend you need to make full use of the app:

1. **Comfortable with English**: Since lesSON is an English-based app, a basic understanding of the language will
ensure a smooth and enjoyable experience.
2. **Typing Proficiency**: lesSON primarily uses a Command Line Interface (CLI) alongside a Graphic User Interface (GUI).
Being comfortable and efficient at typing will help you make the most of the app and enhance your user experience.

`CLI (Command Line Interface):` A CLI is a text-based interface where you interact with the software by typing commands 
nto a terminal or command prompt, providing more direct and precise control over the system.

`Deck:` A scrollable list of flashcards on the GUI.

`Flashcard:` A card created by the user containing its index, question, answer (not shown) and due date.

`Index:` The relative position of a flashcard within the deck.

### Tutorial

This is a tutorial for first-time lesSON users that explains how to add, edit, tag, and practise your flashcards.
For advanced users, feel free to explore the other features in the [feature list](#feature-list) instead.

1. Launch lesSON if you have not done so.
   - Refer to the instructions [here]() if you unsure how to launch lesSON.
   - Note that users who are launching lesSON for the first time will have an empty deck.
2. First, let's try to add your first card. Type the following command and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>: <br>
`add q/what does + mean in boolean algebra? a/it means OR.`
3. Congratulations, you have made your first card. Now, let's try to edit the card created from previous input
and capitalise it! Note that the card just created is at index `1`. Type the following command and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>:
<br>`edit 1 q/What does + mean in boolean algebra? a/It means OR.`
4. Next, let's tag it under the module CS1231S. Type the following command and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>: <br>`edit 1 t/CS1231S`
5. Feel free to add a few more cards by following steps 1 to 3!
6. Next, to practise the first card, do: <br> `practise`
7. Try to recall the answer, and when you are ready to reveal the answer, type the following command and hit
<kbd>Enter</kbd>: <br>`solve`
8. How hard was the answer to recall? Set the difficulty of the card by typing any of the following command and hit
<kbd>Enter</kbd>: <br>
`set d/easy`<br>
`set d/medium`<br>
`set d/hard`
9. The card will automatically be reinserted into deck. This is based on how difficult you found the card. With our inbuilt
spaced repetition system, as you practise, cards you find more difficult will surface more at the top.
10. Note that the `practise`, `solve`, and `set` commands support indexes, but it is recommended to use them without
indexes, as in this tutorial, to always operate on the most difficult card.
11. Get familiar with these commands and when you are ready, do try the other commands available [here]().

##### Expected Result:
![usage of bold syntax](./images/UserGuide/1.3b_bold.png)

#### Italic
To italicise a line of text, wrap text with `*`

##### Example:
```
edit 1 q/How many bits can a <u>Half Adder</u> add up
```
##### Expected Result:
![usage of bold syntax](./images/UserGuide/1.3b_underline.png)


### Important Note:
Do not stack MarkDown Syntaxes

Example:
`` edit 1 q/ *** ``

This may lead to unexpected behavior of text in the display view. In the case when unexpected MarkDown format is observed, edit the flashcard again with the without the MarkDown syntax/ with appropriate syntaxes.

## Importing and Exporting Decks

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about Export and Import**<br>

The import and export functions are meant to be used before and after revision respectively <br>

They are not to be confused as commands input by user, but rather as a method to transfer and import data easily <br>

</div>

Users can share their own Decks with others or download their Decks to their own.
Both import and export features reside in the **File** menu.

### Export
Users can share their own Deck by clicking on the `Export` button. Their own Deck
will be displayed as a JSON file which can be easily copied either through the `Copy Data`
button provided or other means.

### Import
Users can enjoy the Decks of others by clicking on the `Import` button. A text field
is displayed for users to paste in the JSON file containing the decks of others. The
app will close upon clicking the `Import Data` button. Users will have to rerun the app
to see their new decks.

### Caution
All data is saved as a JSON file at this specified path: [JAR file location]/data/deck.json. <br>
It is **NOT** recommended for users to modify data directly as it can cause the app to malfunction. <br>
If you still wish to proceed with modifying the data directly, lesSON would not be held accountable of the risks of such actions.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### I can't run lesSON! What should I do?
Please check that you have correctly installed lesSON by following the instructions [here](#installation). For further
queries, feel free to contact us!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known Issues

1. Tags are not enforced to be unique, meaning it is possible to add multiple tags that are the same. Future enhancements
to lesSON will check for duplicates and remove any if found. Until then, please do take caution to not add duplicate tags
to the same card.
2. When using multiple screens, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the
primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the preferences.json file created by the
application before running the application again.

If you have encountered any bugs or errors, do let us know with the relevant details (e.g. screenshots) via our
official channels found [here]().
