# Flagship User Guide

Flagship is a desktop app for managing internship applications, optimized for use via a [Command Line Interface](#glossary)
(CLI). There is always a swarm of information to keep track of every application season, and many people miss out on important deadlines 
and valuable opportunities because information is not organised neatly. With Flagship, we want you to focus on preparing 
for the interviews, and leave the application management to us.

Flagship has a host of awesome features that we are extremely proud of:
1. **Sorting** internships based on deadlines
2. **Filtering** internships based on interested roles 
3. **Modifying** existing entries in accordance with updates

_... and many more!_

Our main target users are university students pursuing a computing-related degree. As such, this user guide (and Flagship in general)
is designed with the following assumptions in mind
1. You have a basic understanding of command line syntax 
2. You are comfortable using the [command terminal](#glossary) to launch the application
3. You type fast and are love using the keyboard as the main tool of navigation

If these characteristics sound like you, Flagship can get your internship management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

That said, do not get too intimidated as we kept the launching process and commands as simple as possible. You
do not need prior knowledge of industry-level command line syntax to use this application effectively.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Using this guide

We understand that navigating an application for the first time can be incredibly intimidating. As such, we devised this 
user guide to alert you to the main difficulties faced by new users, and inform you of the key features that you can utilise
in your internship management journey. Here is a rundown of how you can use this guide effectively

1. If you are running Flagship for the **first time**, start with our [Quick Start](#quick-start) section
2. If you want a **detailed breakdown** of how each command works, have a read of our [Commands Section](#commands). 
2. If you are an **experienced Flagship user** who wants to have a quick check of the command syntax, jump
right to the [Command Summary](#command-summary).

## Glossary
* **[Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface)** : A text-based interface where you can input commands to interact with the computer's programs
* **Command terminal**: A terminal is a text input and output environment. It is mainly used to launch the application for our purposes. Open your terminal by:
    * Searching and clicking `Command Prompt` on Windows
    * Searching and clicking `Terminal` on Mac and Linux (Ubuntu)
* **Parameters**: Parameters are additional information the command needs in order for it to perform its function successfully
* **JSON**: JSON is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data so that both humans and computers can easily read and understand it


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick Start

Let's start tracking your internship applications right now!
1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `flagship.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W17-1/tp/releases/tag/v1.3).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for Flagship.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar flagship.jar` command to run the application.<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Commands Format Notes

Flagship is powered by commands from your keyboard! All of our features can be accessed by executing various commands.

Here is the command format that will guide you keying in what is necessary for each command. We will be using the <kbd>create</kbd> command
of the following format `create c/COMPANY_NAME ro/ROLE a/APPLICATION_STATUS de/DEADLINE s/START_DATE du/DURATION [re/REQUIREMENT]...` as 
an example.

- The **first word** describes the type of command you want to execute. For the above command, you are executing a <kbd>create</kbd> command.

- **Prefixes** such as <kbd>c/</kbd> serve as the labels for the [parameters](#glossary) in our commands.

- Parameters in <kbd>UPPER_CASE</kbd> are to be supplied by you. For the above command, you might input:

```
create c/GovTech ro/SWE a/Yet to apply de/25/12/2022 s/20/01/2023 du/3 re/C++ 
```
- **Parameters in square brackets <kbd>[]</kbd>** are optional and can be omitted. For the above command, you can choose not to input a single requirement. 

```
create c/GovTech ro/SWE a/Yet to apply de/25/12/2022 s/20/01/2023 du/3
```
- **Parameters with <kbd>...</kbd> behind** can be used multiple times. For the above command, you can input many requirements.

```
create c/GovTech ro/SWE a/Yet to apply de/25/12/2022 s/20/01/2023 du/3 re/C++ re/Java
```

- Parameters can be entered in any order. 
    - For instance, both `c/COMPANY_NAME ro/ROLE` and `ro/ROLE c/COMPANY_NAME` are valid.

## Commands
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Creating an Internship: `create`

Add an internship entry to Flagship.

Format: `create c/COMPANY_NAME ro/ROLE a/APPLICATION_STATUS de/DEADLINE s/START_DATE du/DURATION [re/REQUIREMENTS]...`


**Tip:** Internships can have multiple requirements, or even none at all.
</box>

Examples:
* `create c/Jane Street ro/Coffee maker a/Yet to apply de/15/12/2022 s/20/01/2023 du/3 re/C++ re/Coffee`
* `create c/Citadel ro/Coffee pourer a/Applied de/29/11/2022 s/24/04/2022 du/1`

### Editing an Internship: `modify`

Update details of an existing internship entry.

Format: `modify INDEX c/COMPANY_NAME ro/ROLE a/APPLICATION_STATUS s/START_DATE de/DEADLINE du/DURATION re/REQUIREMENTS...`

* Modify the internship at the specified `INDEX`. This index correlates with the position in the displayed internship list. It **must be a positive integer**, e.g., 1, 2, 3, ‚Ä¶‚Äã.
* New inputs will overwrite existing values.
* Not all categories need to be specified.
* Categories that are not included will keep the previous values.
* Editing requirements will replace current requirements; adding requirements doesn't accumulate.
* Use the command without `re/` to remove all of an internship's requirements.

Examples:
* `modify 1 c/Jane Street ro/Coffee maker a/Yet to apply s/20/01/2023 de/29/11/2022 du/3 re/C++ re/Coffee`

### Filter Internships by Name and Keyword: `filter`

Display internships matching specific category keywords.

Format: `filter [category]/[keyword] ...`

* The search isn't case-sensitive. For instance, `hans` matches `Hans`.
* The sequence of category and keyword doesn't matter.
* Results will include internships matching all keywords (i.e., `AND` search). For instance, `c/JA ro/SWE` matches `c/JANE STREET and ro/SWE` but not `c/JANE STREET ro/Admin` or `c/Google ro/SWE`.
* If you execute a new filter command, it supersedes the previous filter. Otherwise, the initial filter remains active.

Examples:
* `filter c/JA ro/SWE` displays internships with company names containing "JA" and roles containing "SWE".
* `filter` returns the list to its unfiltered state.

### Sort Internships by Category and Order: `sort`

Organize the displayed list based on specific categories and order.

Format: `sort [category]/[ASC/DESC]`

* `ASC` indicates ascending order, and `DESC` denotes descending order.
* A subsequent `sort` command will replace the prior one. Otherwise, the initial sort remains effective.
* The default sort state is by company name in ascending order.
* `sort default` returns the list to its default sort state.

Examples:
* `sort c/ASC` sorts entries by company name (ascending).
* `sort` resets the list to default, which is in order of creation (ascending).

### Deleting an Internship: `delete`

Remove a specified internship from the internship directory.

Format: `delete INDEX`

* Erase the internship at the designated `INDEX`.
* The index corresponds to the position in the displayed internship list.
* The index **must be a positive integer** like 1, 2, 3, ‚Ä¶‚Äã

Examples:
* `delete 2` removes the 2nd internship from the directory.
* Running `sort c/ASC ro/DESC` followed by `delete 1` erases the top internship post-sort.

### Saving the data

InternshipBook data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

InternshipBook data are saved automatically as a [JSON](#glossary) file `[JAR file location]/data/internship.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless></box>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, InternshipBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous InternshipBook home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
