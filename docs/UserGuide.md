## Introduction

#### ***Revolutionise your studying experience with <span style="color: green;">lesSON</span>!***

Welcome to the user guide for <span style="color: green;">lesSON</span>, your ultimate companion in mastering the
Computer Science curriculum at the National University of Singapore (NUS). This guide is designed to provide you with a
comprehensive understanding of the app and how to leverage its powerful features for your academic success.

#### What is lesSON?

<span style="color: green;">lesSON</span> is not just another study app; it's a game-changer in the world of education.
Tailored specifically for NUS Computer Science students, this **desktop application** enables incredibly easy creation
of flashcards for revision. It employs the efficacy of [active recall](#definitions) when you practise with the
[flashcards](#definitions) you made to increase memory retention. Say goodbye to time-consuming note-taking,
and say hello to a more efficient, effective, and enjoyable study experience.

Made with the intention to maximise your study experience, here are some features we believe you'll love:
1. **Enhanced Memory Retention:** Thanks to lesSON's inbuilt [spaced repetition](#definitions) system, you can
supercharge your memory and recall the important details needed. The app optimizes when you should review your
flashcards, ensuring you remember and grasp complex concepts with ease.
2. **Intuitive Card Categorisation:** lesSON helps you categorize your flashcards based on subject. This feature
makes it a breeze to organize and access specific topics, keeping your study sessions focused and productive.

*... and many more!*

#### Prerequisites

Before you get started with <span style="color: green;">lesSON</span>, here's what we recommend you need to make
full use of the app:

- **Comfortable with English**: Since <span style="color: green;">lesSON</span> is an English-based app, a basic
understanding of the language will ensure a smooth and enjoyable experience.
- **Typing Proficiency**: <span style="color: green;">lesSON</span> primarily uses a
[Command Line Interface (CLI)](#definitions) on top of a [Graphic User Interface (GUI)](#definitions). This means that
most of the interaction with <span style="color: green;">lesSON</span> is through the use of [keystrokes](#definitions).
Being comfortable and efficient at typing will help you make the most of the app and enhance your user experience.

you have created to you. Here is a brief overview of the GUI to help you familiarise yourself with the key elements and
their locations.

![gui_overview](./images/UserGuide/1.3b_ui_overview.png)

Here is a summary of what each component in the GUI displays.

| Name of component | Description                                                                                                                                                |

### Tutorial

This is a tutorial for **first-time** and **beginner** <span style="color: green;">lesSON</span> users. For more advanced users,
feel free to explore the other features in the [feature list](#feature-list) instead. In this tutorial, we will explain how to
*add, edit, tag, and practise* your flashcards.

1. Launch <span style="color: green;">lesSON</span>.
   - Refer to the instructions [here](#installation) if you are unsure how to launch
   <span style="color: green;">lesSON</span>.
   - Note that users who are launching <span style="color: green;">lesSON</span> for the first time will have an
   empty deck.
2. First, let's try to add your very first flashcard. Type the following command and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>: <br>
`add q/what does + mean in boolean algebra? a/it means OR.`
3. Congratulations, you have created your first flashcard! Now, let's try to edit the card created from the
previous input by capitalising it! Note that the flashcard just created is at index `1`. Type the following command
and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>: <br>`edit 1 q/What does + mean in boolean algebra? a/It means OR.`
4. Next, let's tag it under the module CS1231S. Type the following command and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>:
<br>`edit 1 t/CS1231S`
5. Let's add another flashcard. Type the following command and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>: <br>
`add q/What are the different hazards to consider when using pipelining? a/Structural, Data and Control t/CS2100`
6. Feel free to add a few more cards by following steps 1 to 4!
7. Next, to practise the first card, do: <br> `practise`
8. Try to recall the answer, and when you are ready to reveal the answer, type the following command and hit
<kbd>Enter</kbd>: <br>`solve`
9. How hard was the answer to recall? Set the difficulty of the flashcard by typing any of the following command and hit
<kbd>Enter</kbd>: <br>
`set d/easy`<br>
`set d/medium`<br>
`set d/hard`
10. The flashcard will automatically be reinserted into deck. This is based on how difficult you found the question
to be. With our inbuilt [spaced repetition](#glossary) system, as you practise, flashcards you find more difficult will
surface more at the top.
11. Note that the `practise`, `solve`, and `set` commands support indexes, but we recommended to use them without
indexes as shown in this tutorial. This is to optimise the effectiveness of the [spaced repetition](#glossary) by
testing your memory with the most difficult flashcard.
12. Get familiar with these commands and when you are ready, move on to the other commands listed [here]().

edit 1 q/How many bits can a **Half Adder** add up
```
##### Expected Result:
![usage of bold syntax](./images/UserGuide/1.3b_bold.png)

#### Italic
To italicise a line of text, wrap text with `*`

##### Example:
```

```
##### Expected Result:
![usage of bold syntax](./images/UserGuide/1.3b_italics.png)

#### Underline
To underline a line of text, insert `<u>` at the beginning of the text,
and end with `</u>` at the end of the underlined text.

##### Example:
```
edit 1 q/How many bits can a <u>Half Adder</u> add up
```
##### Expected Result:
![usage of bold syntax](./images/UserGuide/1.3b_underline.png)


### Important Note:
Do not stack MarkDown Syntaxes

Example:
`` edit 1 q/ *** ``

This may lead to unexpected behavior of text in the display view. In the case when unexpected MarkDown format is observed, edit the flashcard again with the without the MarkDown syntax/ with appropriate syntaxes.

## Importing and Exporting Decks

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about Export and Import**<br>

The import and export functions are meant to be used before and after revision respectively <br>

They are not to be confused as commands input by user, but rather as a method to transfer and import data easily <br>

</div>

Users can share their own Decks with others or download their Decks to their own.
Both import and export features reside in the **File** menu.

### Export
Users can share their own Deck by clicking on the `Export` button. Their own Deck
will be displayed as a JSON file which can be easily copied either through the `Copy Data`
button provided or other means.

### Import
Users can enjoy the Decks of others by clicking on the `Import` button. A text field
is displayed for users to paste in the JSON file containing the decks of others. The
app will close upon clicking the `Import Data` button. Users will have to rerun the app
to see their new decks.

### Caution
All data is saved as a JSON file at this specified path: [JAR file location]/data/deck.json. <br>
It is **NOT** recommended for users to modify data directly as it can cause the app to malfunction. <br>
If you still wish to proceed with modifying the data directly, lesSON would not be held accountable of the risks of such actions.

## Known Issues

1. As of v1.4, users can create duplicate tags for the same flashcard. We plan to enforce uniqueness of tags for a
flashcard in future enhancements. Until then, please do take caution to avoid adding duplicate tags for the same
flashcard.
2. As of v1.4, the app may not show for users with multiple displays. If you relocate the app to a secondary display and
subsequently cease using the secondary display, the app will continue to run but will no longer be visible on your
primary display. Closing the app and re-running it will not solve the issue. We are working on a solution but until then,
we recommend relocating the app back to your main display before disconnecting your secondary display.
