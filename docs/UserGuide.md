# Glossary

### Definitions

`Deck` - A scrollable list of flashcards on the GUI.

`Flashcard`- A card created by the user containing its index, question, answer (not shown) and due date.

`Index` - The relative position of a flashcard within the deck.

`Parameter` - Field that needs to be filled up.

### Parameter Information

The parameters used in lesSON have certain specifications. Here are some information to guide you through 
how to use them. Invalid inputs are just one of many examples of invalid inputs. Cases that do not appear in the table may also be invalid if it is not of the accepted format.

| Parameters can be input in any order                                                   | Parameters can be reordered without having any effect on the command.                                                                                                                          | `add q/QUESTION a/ANSWER` and `add a/ANSWER q/QUESTION` are both valid inputs that generates the same card.                       |
| Commands that do not take in any parameters will disregard extraneous parameters.      | Certain commands such as `help`, `clear`, `exit`, `random` and `list` (in certain cases, see [list](#view-all-flashcards--list) for more details) will disregard any inputs after the command. | `help 123 ` or `clear a/abc` will be regarded as `help` and `clear`.                                                              |

# User Interface Overview

Here is a quick overview of the user interface to get you oriented with where things are.

![gui_overview](./images/UserGuide/1.3b_ui_overview.png)

* Command Line Box - lesSON is optimised for typing commands. Type your commands in the command box
to create and change flashcards!
* Result Box - after inputting a command, the result will show up here. Any errors produced will also appear here, for
instance in the event of a wrongfully formatted command.
* Deck List - shows the list of flashcards

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Tutorial

This tutorial explains how to add, edit, tag, and practise your flashcards. Feel free to follow along with lesSON open!
For advanced users, feel free to look at the [feature list](#feature-list) instead.

1. Firstly, let's add a card. type: <br>`add q/what does + mean in boolean algebra? a/it means OR.`
2. Next, let's capitalise our previous input! Assuming the card is at index `1`, input: <br>`edit 1 q/What does + mean in boolean
algebra? a/It means OR.`
3. Next, let's tag it under the module CS1231S by inputting: <br>`edit 1 t/CS1231S`
4. Feel free to add a few more cards by following steps 1 to 3!
5. Next, to practise the first card, do: <br> `practise`
6. Try to recall the answer, and when you are ready to reveal the answer, do: <br> `solve`
7. How hard was the answer to recall? set the difficulty by doing one of these: <br>
`set d/easy`
`set d/medium`
`set d/hard`
8. The card will automatically be reinserted into deck. This is based on how difficult you found the card. Due to our
spaced repetition system, as you practise, the more difficult cards will surface more at the top.
9. Note that the `practise`, `solve`, and `set` commands support indexes, but it is recommended to use them without
indexes, as in this tutorial, to always operate on the most difficult card.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Feature list

### Adding a Flashcard: `add`

   ![result of solve command](./images/UserGuide/1.3b_solve_ans.png)


### Setting Difficulty of Flashcards: `set`
Setting the difficulty of a flashcard

This difficulty refers to how difficult you found the flashcard.
This flashcard will be rescheduled based on the difficulty, as indicated by their due date.
More difficult cards will appear more often in the practice rotation.
This also takes into account past practices, so the more a card is practised,
the less it will appear in the practice rotation.

Format: set INDEX DIFFICULTY

#### Acceptable values for each parameters:
1. Index must be positive integer
2. Index cannot exceed size of the deck
3. Difficulty must be either ‚Äòeasy‚Äô, ‚Äòmedium‚Äô, ‚Äòhard‚Äô

#### Example:
```
set 1
```

#### Expected outputs:
```
set 1 d/easy
"Set Difficulty for Question 1 (Diffculty Level: easy)

set 10 d/easy
"The card index provided is invalid"
```

#### Usage:
1. User Input
   ![usage of set command](./images/UserGuide/1.3b_set.png)

2. Successful Output
   ![result of set command](./images/UserGuide/1.3b_set_ans.png)

### Randomly Practise Flashcards: `random`
Practise a single Flashcard in the deck. This command chooses a random flashcard,
as opposed to `practise` command which chooses the first (highest priority) flashcard.
Use `r` index with `solve` and `set` for this random card.

Format: `random`

#### Acceptable values for each parameters:
* There are no parameters.

#### Examples:
```
random
(showcases a random question)
```
#### Expected outputs:
```
random
"Practising question 1 : <provided question>"
```
Note: since the output is random, the above can be any question.


### Clear all flashcards: `clear`
Clears all flashcards found in the Deck. Deck is reset back to empty.

Format: clear

#### Example:
```
clear
```

#### Expected outputs:
```
clear
"Deck has been cleared!"
```
### Setting goals: `goal`
Set a goal for the current studying session.
Initially, the goal is set to 0, and out of the number of cards due that day

ie. If you have 5 cards due that day, it will be set to 0/5 initially

Format: goal NUMBER

#### Example:
```
goal 5
```

### Important Note:
Do not stack MarkDown Syntax

Example:
`` edit 1 q/ *** ``

This may lead to unexpected behavior of text in the display view.

>>>>>>> master
### Getting help: `help`
Seek more details from a link provided leading to the User Guide.
Users can also access this function by clicking on the **File** button located at the top
left of the application, and then navigating to the **Help** tab.

Format: help

#### Example:
```
help
```

#### Expected outputs:
```
help
(A window with the URL leading to the User Guide will pop out.
Users can copy the URL by simply clicking on the 'Copy URL' button.)
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Additional Features

## MarkDown Syntax

For user who wish to incorporate styling in lesSON, there are 3 font styles currently supported:
1. Bold
2. Italic
3. Underline

### Bold
To bold a line of text, wrap text with `**`

#### Example:
```
edit 1 q/How many bits can a **Half Adder** add up
```
#### Expected Result:
![usage of bold syntax](./images/UserGuide/1.3b_bold.png)

### Italic
To italicise a line of text, wrap text with `*`

#### Example:
```
edit 1 q/How many bits can a *Half Adder* add up
```
#### Expected Result:
![usage of bold syntax](./images/UserGuide/1.3b_italics.png)

### Underline
To underline a line of text, insert `<u>` at the beginning of the text,
and end with `</u>` at the end of the underlined text.

#### Example:
```
edit 1 q/How many bits can a <u>Half Adder</u> add up
```
#### Expected Result:
![usage of bold syntax](./images/UserGuide/1.3b_underline.png)


### Important Note:
Do not stack MarkDown Syntaxes

Example:
`` edit 1 q/ *** ``


This may lead to unexpected behavior of text in the display view. In the case when unexpected MarkDown format is observed, edit the flashcard again with the without the MarkDown syntax/ with appropriate syntaxes.
